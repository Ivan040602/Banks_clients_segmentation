<h2> Banks' clients segmentation </h2>

<b> In the following project I used to create the appropriate data segmentation and clustering using depersonalized data set of the banks' clients. The following task was done using three different approaches which managed to identify different clusters of customers for further optimal work of the bank with each of the identified segments. As a result of we got the interpretations of the clusters and some visualizations of them.<br/>These approaches are as follows:
-   K-means algorithm <br/>
-   Decision trees<br/>
-   RFM clustering
